              <p>
                Non personal information is information that cannot identify

                Are Cookies or Other Technologies Used to Collect Personal
                Information?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web
                beacons, to collect information on our website. A cookie is a
                text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.
                Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to
                your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can
                only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the
                cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to
                provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a
                cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a
                specific page. For example, if you register with us, a cookie
                helps Africave to recall your specific information on subsequent
                visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
                information, such as mailing addresses, and so on. When you
                return to the same Africave website, the information you
                previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the
                features that you customized. A web beacon is a small graphic
                image that allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor
                and collect certain information about the viewer of the web
                page, web-based document or email message, such as the type of
                browser requesting the web beacon, the IP address of the
                computer that the web beacon is sent to and the time the web
                beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small and invisible
                to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as
                part of a web page or email, including HTML based content, can
                act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to count visitors to
                the web pages on the website or to monitor how our users
                navigate the web site, and we may include web beacons in email
                messages in order to count how many messages sent were actually
                opened, acted upon or forwarded. <br /><br />Third party vendors
                also may use cookies on our website. For instance, we may
                contract with third parties who will use cookies on our web site
                to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume statistical
                information from our visitors and members. Such information is
                shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. These
                third parties use persistent cookies to help us to improve the
                visitor experience, to manage our site content, and to track
                visitor behavior. <br /><br />To help measure and improve the
                effectiveness of our email communications, the third party sets
                cookies. All data collected by this third party on behalf of
                Africave is used solely by or on behalf of Africave and is
                shared externally only on an anonymous, aggregated basis. From
                time to time, we may allow third parties to post advertisements
                on our website, and those third-party advertisements may include
                a cookie or web beacon served by the third party. This Privacy
                Policy does not cover the use of information collected from you
                by third party ad servers. We do not control cookies in such
                third party ads, and you should check the privacy policies of
                those advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of
                cookies and other technology before linking to an ad. We will
                not share your personal information with these companies, but
                these companies may use information about your visits to our
                website and other websites in order to provide advertisements on
                our website and other websites about goods and services that may
                be of interest to you, and they may share your personal
                information that you provide to them with others.

                How Does Africave Use Personal Information?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Africave may keep and use personal information we collect from
                or about you to provide you with access to this website or other
                products or services, to respond to your requests, to bill you
                for products/services you purchased, to provide ongoing service
                and support, to contact you with information that might be of
                interest to you, including information about products and
                services of ours and of others, or ask for your opinion about
                our products or the products of others, for record keeping and
                analytical purposes and to research, develop and improve
                programs, products, services and content. Personal information
                collected online may be combined with the information you
                provide to us through other sources. We may also remove your
                personal identifiers (your name, email address, etc). In this
                case, you would no longer be identified as a single unique
                individual. Once we have de-identified information, it is
                non-personal information and we may treat it like other non-
                personal information. Finally, we may use your personal
                information to protect our rights or property, or to protect
                someone’s health, safety or welfare, and to comply with a law or
                regulation, court order or other legal process.

                Does Africave Share Personal Information with Others?
              </h2>
              <p>
                We will not share your personal information collected from this
                website with an unrelated third party without your permission,
                except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. In the
                ordinary course of business, we may share some personal
                information with companies that we hire to perform services or
                functions on our behalf. In all cases in which we share your
                personal information with a third party for the purpose of
                providing a service to us, we will not authorize them to keep,
                disclose or use your information with others except for the
                purpose of providing the services we asked them to provide.
                <br />
                <br />
                We will not sell, exchange or publish your personal information,
                except in conjunction with a corporate sale, merger,
                dissolution, or acquisition. For some sorts of transactions, in
                addition to our direct collection of information, our third
                party service vendors (such as banks) who may provide such
                services as credit, insurance, and escrow services may collect
                personal information directly from you to assist you with your
                transaction. We do not control how these third parties use such
                information, but we do ask them to disclose how they use your
                personal information before they collect it. If you submit a
                review for a third party (person or business) using our Facebook
                Fan Review Application, during the submission process we ask
                your permission to gather your basic information (such as name
                and email address) which we then share with the third party for
                whom you are submitting the review. We may be legally compelled
                to release your personal information in response to a court
                order, subpoena, search warrant, law or regulation.

                (or illegal). We may disclose your personal information to third
                parties if we feel that the disclosure is necessary to protect
                our rights or property, protect someone’s health, safety or
                welfare, or to comply with a law or regulation, court order or
                other legal process. As discussed in the section on cookies and

                advertisers use of your personal information, and you should

                through this website, please contact us, and we will endeavor to
                delete that information from our databases.
